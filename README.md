# raspi-cam-reduce
A small Script to reduce the number of pictures taken with my timelapse script "raspi-cam.py" according to a given interval.
My files are sorted in subfolders and the filename ist like: **2019-12-31_2056.jpg**

**The format is important, because the script reads out the time of the filename to calculate the interval between taken pictures.**
